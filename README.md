### one liner installation (DANGER)
`cd ~/dev; git clone https://github.com/akdetrick/dotfiles.git; ./install.sh`

*NOTE*: don't run install.sh unless you want to wipe out lots of local configuration files, which is really really bad, unless you're me and you(me) is doing this intentionally.

### updating plugins/tools
`cd ~/dev; ./update.sh`
